# Unraveling the Link Between Education Inequality and Income Distribution

Learning Goals

Familiarize ourselves with relevant datasets, reports and case studies.
Quantify the extent of inequality and education across nations.
Explore statistical measures (such as Gini coefficients) to assess disparities in educational resources, funding, and opportunities.
Gather relevant data on education indicators and poverty metrics.
Interpret coefficients: Understand how changes in education variables affect poverty.

Variables

Data sets. Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data.
Standardize units: Ensure consistency (e.g., convert literacy rates to percentages).
Merge datasets: Combine education and poverty data. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 


Introduction

As we embark on this data-driven exploration, weâ€™ll analyze cross-country data and uncover patterns that illuminate the intricate relationship between public spending, education and income.

Our Hypothesis: Countries with higher inequality tend to invest less in education perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

Our working hypothesis posits that countries grappling with higher income inequality often find themselves caught in a discouraging pattern. 
These nations tend to allocate fewer resources to education, resulting in limited educational opportunities for marginalized populations. As a result, this perpetuates the existing income gaps.
